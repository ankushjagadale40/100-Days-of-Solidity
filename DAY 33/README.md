In Solidity, a function selector is a unique identifier that represents a function's signature. It is used in Ethereum smart contracts to enable the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to determine which function is being called when a transaction is sent to a contract. Function selectors are critical for contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) encoding and decoding, enabling contracts to interact with each other.
The function selector is the first four bytes (32 bits) of the Keccak-256 hash of the function signature. The function signature is the concatenation of the function name and its parameter types.

Function selectors in Solidity are used for efficient function dispatch in smart contracts, reducing gas costs, and preventing naming clashes. They enable standardized ABI encoding and ensure secure and interoperable contract interactions.
