The try-catch construct in Solidity allows developers to catch errors that occur during external function calls or contract creations. It acts as a safety net, providing a fallback mechanism to mitigate any potential issues.

The try-catch block consists of a “try” statement, followed by one or more “catch” statements.

Try: The try block contains the code that you want to execute. If an exception or error occurs within this block, it will propagate to the catch block.

Catch: The catch block specifies what should happen if an error occurs in the try block. It can handle specific errors or provide a fallback response.
